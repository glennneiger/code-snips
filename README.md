### Concept
I needed a better way to store commands or coding snippets I use on a frequent basis, properly categrorized and efficient to copy/paste. With Code Snips I am hoping to build a functional customizable snippet repo with a well-designed UI.

### Feature Roadmap - Frontend
- [x] Able to view code snippets
- [x] Snippets are organized in custom containers
- [x] Snippets can be edited and saved
- [x] Edit can be canceled, with Snippets returning to their previous state
- [x] Click a Snippet to copy it to clipboard
- [ ] Able to Delete Snippets and Containers
- [ ] New Snippets can be added to each container
- [ ] New Code Containers can be added
- [ ] Able to edit Container title
- [ ] Search bar for filtering through all Snippets
- [ ] Side Panel for favorite pins

### Next Phase
Once I have completed the Frontend roadmap, I will start implementing a backend server to add dynamic persistence within the app.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
